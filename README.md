This is a form designer web app tool that allows developers to add any input fields (input, textarea, select) and delete the field according to their need.
Drag and drop feature is also implemented here to reorder the input fields accordingly.
On saving the record, the json data will be console logged in the dev tools for tracking the record of it.
